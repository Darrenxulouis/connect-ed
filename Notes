//Server Setup
create server.js in root folder

imperative to define express using const app = express();

express needs to have a get
app.get('/', (req,res) => res.send('Hello')); 
This will return hello from the response

we also need to define a port
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

and express needs to have a listen
app.listen(port, ()=> console.log("listening on port"));

//MongoDB setup
mongoose
  .connect(db)
  .then(() => console.log("MongoDB Connected"))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));

  mongoose.connect() is a promised based. Therefore, if successful, it will return a promise (.then()).
  if not, it will return an error from catch
